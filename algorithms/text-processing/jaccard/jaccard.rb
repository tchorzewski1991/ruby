    # The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets,
    # and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of
    # the union of the sample sets. Algorithm itself is also known as the
    # Jaccard index or the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Algorithm refers
    # to a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of
    # sample collections.
    #
    # Example: Basic usage
    #   Returns value of similarity between origin and target
    #
    #   Jaccard::Words.coefficient 'apple', 'applet'
    #   => 0.8
    #
    # Example: Basic usage
    #   Returns value of distance between origin and target
    #
    #   Jaccard::Words.distance 'apple', 'applet'
    #   => 0.2

      # basing on both of collections.
