# ruby-scripts
The main point of this repo is to practice different techniques and attempts of programming in Ruby language.
Before I had been started I took into account that not every piece of code in this repo needs to be the best
possible solution for particular problem. Please, feel welcome to open issues and comment on that :)

**Algorithms** -
This section covers a lot of text-processing related transformations. These are definitely crucial basics for everyone who wants to understand Natural Language Processing engines under the hood.

Quick note for the sake of clarification: Most of the time I decided to focus on algorithms implementation
itself, rather than using built-in Ruby methods and features. (ex. Enumerable module). I suppose that many algorithms implemented on this repo could be easily (or not) replaced with some other, more common and suitable solution.
Someone may wonder, why am I doing such a thing? There is no more reason other than practise. I just love to explore       Ruby, as well as digging into how something has been, or need to be implemented.

**Performance** -
This section is focused on playing around complex Ruby syntax. With such an elegant language, in most cases there is a        lot of solutions for the particular problem. I strongly believe that context of performance matters.

### Performance
- Array#join vs other less common approaches
- String-operations: Multiple choices for removing first char
- Counting occurrence of array elements

### Metaprogramming
- Singleton methods

### Enumerations
- Modulo - first n-th, n modulo m equations
- Interpose - Clojure inspired interposing fn()
- PrimeNumbers - self explanatory, but with small twist

### Data Structures
- Linked List (with basic actions)
- Circular List (with basic actions)
