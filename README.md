# ruby-scripts
The main point of this repo is to practise different techniques and attempts of programming in Ruby language.
Before I had been started I took into account that not every piece of code in this repo needs to be the best 
possible solution. Please, feel welcome to open issues and comment on that :)

**Algorithms** section covers a lot of text-processing related transformations. These are cruciual basics for
everyone who wants to understand Natural Language Processing engines.

Quick clarification note for 'Algorithms' section - most of the time I decided to focus on algorithms implementation
itself, rather than using built-in Ruby features. (ex. Enumerable module). I suppose that many algorithms implemented
on this repo could be easily (or not) replaced with some other, more common and suitable solution to Ruby.
Someone may wonder, why am I doing such a thing? Well, it is not so hard to find almost complete solution within
documentation. There is no more reason other than just one - I just love coding in Ruby.

**Performance** section is nothing more than 'cheatsheet' for understanding ruby better. Have you ever wonder if is it possible to code something in a more performant and maintainable way? Yes, me too.

- PrimeNumbers - self explanatory, but with small twist

### Data Structures
- Linked List (with basic actions)
- Circular List (with basic actions)

### Others
