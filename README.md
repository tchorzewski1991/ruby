# ruby-scripts
The main point of this repo is to practice different techniques and attempts of programming in Ruby language.
Before I had been started I took into account that not every piece of code in this repo needs to be the best
possible solution. Please, feel welcome to open issues and comment on that :)

**Algorithms** section covers a lot of text-processing related transformations, but not only. These are definitely crucial basics for
everyone who wants to understand Natural Language Processing engines.

Quick clarification note for 'Algorithms' section - most of the time I decided to focus on algorithms implementation
itself, rather than using built-in Ruby features. (ex. Enumerable module). I suppose that many algorithms implemented
on this repo could be easily (or not) replaced with some other, more common and suitable solution to Ruby.
Someone may wonder, why am I doing such a thing? Well, it is not so hard to find almost complete solution within
documentation. There is no more reason other than just one - I just love coding in Ruby.

**Performance** section is nothing more than playing around complex ruby syntax. With such an elegant language, there needs to be lot of solutions to particular problem. Have you ever wonder if is it possible to code something in a more performant and maintainable way?

### Performance
- Array#join vs other less common approaches
- String-operations: Multiple choices for removing first char
- Counting occurrence of array elements

### Metaprogramming
- Singleton methods

### Enumerations
- Modulo - first n-th, n modulo m equations
- Interpose - Clojure inspired interposing fn()
- PrimeNumbers - self explanatory, but with small twist

### Data Structures
- Linked List (with basic actions)
- Circular List (with basic actions)
